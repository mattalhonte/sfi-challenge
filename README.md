agentfuncs.py is the code doing the actual work.  It is gloriously messy.  I may clean it up someday.  Who knows!

ComplexityChallengeWriteup.ipynb is what I submitted.  No code, just words, graphs, and tables.

Usage_Example.ipynb has an example of using the actual code to make something like what's in the writeup.
